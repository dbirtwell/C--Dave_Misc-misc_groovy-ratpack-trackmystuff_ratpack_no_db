# Ratpack Track MY Stuff App - NO DB

A simple Groovy/Ratpack mocked CRUD application prototype WITHOUT actual database access.
The actual data is hardcoded for now ... the next step is to at least create an internal "list" that can be updated dynamically via the application, thus mocking a real DB-attached CRUD app.
This is a port of a fully functioning version I created previously using Sinatra/Ruby.

Eventually, there will be a version of this application which handles actual CRUD to a database.

This was created as a learning and proof-of-concept project for BOTH Groovy and Ratpack, and is not expected to be beautiful by any means.

ratpack.groovy is the main app/script

to start the app just type > groovy ratpack.groovy

I know, I know, there aren't any tests. I'll add some later.

NOTE:

This is based upon several resources I discovered on the internet.
I will add resource links links when I update the project.
